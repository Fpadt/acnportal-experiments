Specifically, we use outputs from simulations of the JPL ACN with different charging algorithms as inputs to a pandapower power flow at varying timesteps in a simple electrical grid. We experiment with adding EV charging to a grid already loaded with offices.\n",

    "We can analyze the results of our simulations in the larger context of the electrical grid. Let's take the perspective of a system designer who wants to add EV charging to some sites without straining the rest of the electrical grid. Say the grid is configured like the Pandapower small branches-out test network, given at https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1.0/networks/test.html:\n",

    "We start with a medium office building load on each of the four loads in the network. Pandapower power flows are static evaluations, so we will conduct a power flow at each timestep to understand how the grid behaves in time. First, some functions to help us construct the network, assign its loads, and run power flows. To avoid having to change the test case from the pandapower specification, we divide all loads by 2, which doesn't change relative load sizes and so is acceptable for the purposes of this study. To see the functions used to start the pandapower experiment, expand the cell below. We compile the simulation results into one DataFrame and then run power flows for 3 cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Only the building (medium office) is on each load; the scenario before EV chariging is added.\n",

    "2. EV chariging is added but the charging is uncontrolled. For a given timestep, each load is then the sum of the builidng load and the aggregate load from uncontrolled charging calculable from our ACN-Sim simulations.\n",

    "For the base load (blue curve), we can see that at worst, we are 2% below the nominal voltage. By adding uncontrolled EV charging, we have dropped drastically below the nominal voltage, over 16% lower. When we schedule our EV charging, we see we have reduced our voltage drop from nominal to only about 10%. Thus, we see the benefits of scheduled charging for grid performance metrics relative to uncontrolled EV charging. Indeed, scheduled EV charging allows us to do much more than just sorted scheduling algorithms; with grid health in mind, we may use objectives such as signal following or canceling to even further reduce grid strain from EV charging to more acceptable levels. This is an active area of research that makes heavy use of both ACN-Sim and grid simulators in manners similar to those demonstrated here."
