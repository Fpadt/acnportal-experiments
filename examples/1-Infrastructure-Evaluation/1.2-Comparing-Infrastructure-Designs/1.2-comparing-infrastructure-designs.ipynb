    "\n",
    "In this case study, we demonstrate how ACN-Data and ACN-Sim can be used to evaluate infrastructure configurations and algorithms. We consider the case of a site host who expects to charge approximately 100 EVs per day with a demand pattern similar to that of JPL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The site host has several options, including  \n",
    "*   102 Uncontrolled Level-1 EVSEs with a 200 kW Transformer\n",
    "*   30 Uncontrolled Level-2 EVSEs with a 200 kW Transformer\n",
    "*   102 Uncontrolled Level-2 EVSEs with a 670 kW Transformer\n",
    "*   102 Smart Level-2 EVSEs running LLF with a 200 kW Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate the scenarios on the number of times drivers would have to swap parking places to allow other drivers to charge, the percentage of total demand met, and the operating costs (calculated using ACN-Sim's integration with utility tariffs). This demonstrates the significant benefits of developing smart EV charging systems in terms of reducing both capital costs (transformer capacity) and operating costs.\n"

    "\n",
    "To define our charging network options, we will use two functions which generate a StochasticNetwork object. The StochasticNetwork assigns users to spaces dynamically based on available spaces. In this example, we will assume each driver has equal preference for all spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all spaces are taken, drivers join a queue which is drained as drivers finish charging and move their vehicle (the early departure option specifies that drivers move their vehicle when it is done charging rather than their normal departure time). We record each time that the user leave and is replaced with someone from the queue as a swap. Swaps are undesirable as they waste time and are frustrating for users. Despite this, swapping is a common practice in many charging facilities where the number of users exceeds the number of EVSEs.  "
