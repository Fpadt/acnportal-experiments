# ACN-Sim Case Study
## Comparing Baseline Algorithms in Constrained Infrastructure

To demonstrate the usefulness of ACN-Sim we present a simple case study. In this study, we compare the percentage of energy demands which are met at various infrastructure capacities for Earliest Deadline First, Least Laxity First, First Come First Served, and Round Robin. 

## Try it.
You can try this experiment online without needing to install anything on your local machine using Google Colab. 
https://colab.research.google.com/github/zach401/acnsim_baseline_comparison/blob/master/baseline_algorithms_w_constrained_infrastructure.ipynb

You will likely see a message "Warning: This notebook was not authored by Google." Click "Run Anyway". If you feel more comfortable, you can reset your runtimes, if other Colab notebooks have access to your private data. **This script does not attempt to access any of your data.**
